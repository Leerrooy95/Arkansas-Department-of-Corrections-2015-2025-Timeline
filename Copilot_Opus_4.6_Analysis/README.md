Lead Analyst workstation for the Arkansas DOC Timeline project.

---

## Purpose

This folder serves as the working directory for independent verification, supplementary research, and analysis conducted by GitHub Copilot (Opus 4.6) in support of the main repository.

## Folder Structure

```
Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── Verification_Reports/        # Independent data verification and source cross-checks
│   ├── core_data_verification.md
│   └── data_interpretation_guide.md
└── Archived/                    # Superseded files (preserved, not deleted)
```

## Methodology

- **Source triangulation**: All core findings verified against official state publications, legislative records, and independent news coverage
- **Cross-reference**: Death and population figures compared across ADC monthly reports, Director's Board Reports, legislative testimony, and Arkansas Advocate / White River Now reporting (December 2025)
- **Statistical review**: Permutation test methodology reviewed for correctness and reproducibility
- **Transparency**: Original files preserved in `Archived/` — nothing deleted
